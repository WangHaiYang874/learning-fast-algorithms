# learning-fast-algorithms
This is a repo for me to familiarize with fast algorithms, numerical linear algebra, and fortran95. The goals are

- [ ] implement a fmm for the laplace equation in fortran. 
- [ ] prototypical numerical linear algebra algorithms
  - [ ] Interpolative Decomposition
  - [ ] randomized numerical linear algebras. 
- [ ] open-mp parallel with fortran

As creating this project, I have zero experience in fortran and randomized numerical linear algebra. I only have a superficial experience with fortran, and some experience with python. I hope at the end I will be able to implement many fast algorithms.
